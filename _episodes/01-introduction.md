teaching: 5
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is a command shell and why would I use one?"
objectives:
- "Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs."
- "Explain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces."
keypoints:
- "A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs."
-  "This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix."
-  "Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt."
- "The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines."
- "The shell's main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be."

### Background

Humans and computers commonly interact in many different ways, such as through a keyboard and mouse, touch screen interfaces, or using speech recognition systems.
The most widely used way to interact with personal computers is called a **graphical user interface** (GUI).
With a GUI, we give instructions by clicking a mouse and using menu-driven interactions.

While the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to learn, this way of delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly.

The Unix shell is both a **command-line interface** (CLI) and a scripting language, allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast.
With the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification as many times as we want.
Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.
